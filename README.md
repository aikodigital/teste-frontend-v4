# Aiko Test

## Description

You are the frontend developer for a company that collects data from equipment used in forestry operations. Among this data are the historical positions and states of the equipment. The state of a piece of equipment is used to indicate what the equipment was doing at a particular moment, whether it was Operating, Idle, or Under Maintenance. The state changes according to the equipment's usage in the operation, while the equipmentâ€™s position is collected via GPS and sent and stored periodically by the application.

Your goal is to use this data to develop the frontend of a web application that processes and displays this information to the operation managers.

## Requirements

These requirements are mandatory and must be developed for the test delivery.

    Equipment positions: Display the equipment on the map at their most recent positions.

    Current equipment state: View the most recent state of the equipment. For example, showing it on the map as a pop-up, mouse hover over the equipment, etc.

    Equipment state history: Allow viewing the state history of a specific piece of equipment when clicking on the equipment.
